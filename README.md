# TeamShare (front end)

TeamShare is an app built using a Rails API back end and a React front end.

The big news is that this app is currently a *work in progress*. 

Andrew Hibbard and Anna Wijetunga paired up to create an app that would make life easier for folks who need to contribute to the same project.

## Our goal

To have a functioning app the whole way. Build the skateboard, then the car.

## Progress toward our goal

The **back end** of our app currently has:
- Rails
- Routes and a scoped route
- Models and a schema
- Users, projects and objectives controllers
- User, project and objective serializers
- Fast JSON API

The **front end** of our app currently has:
- React

## What we're working on next

- User authentication with React!
- A really, really, really engaging readme!

## Dream List

- User authentication (i.e. login)
- Mailer feature for reminders
- Redux flow
- RSPEC (unit testing)
- React Jest testing

## Overview

TeamShare is just what you need to keep track of your work on any project with a partner or a team. Create an account (or log in to an existing account) in order to track projects you're working on in collaboration with your team.

At any moment, you can see any and all users working on your project, as well as the deadline for its completion. You can also track objectives for each project, and each objective can belong to one or many users.

Once complete, you can mark a project as completed and move on to the next project.

Happy building!
